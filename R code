# Introduction

Hello, everyone! Today marks the beginning of my journey into data cleaning with R. To practice, I’ll be diving into the **nycflights13** dataset, learning how to organize and transform data effectively.

## Setting Up the Data

To get started, let’s load the dataset by installing and loading the necessary packages.

```{r setup, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
install.packages("nycflights13")
library(nycflights13)
```

## A Quick Overview Of the Dataset
View the entire dataset (opens in a separate tab)

                              View(flights)

To display the first few rows, following the command below:
```{r head, message=FALSE}
head(flights)
```

## For A More Detailed View Of Data Structure
```{r message=FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)
glimpse(flights)
```

## Cleaning The Data
After inspecting the data, we’ll clean it by removing rows with missing values using `drop_na()` from **tidyr**.

```{r clean_data, message=FALSE}
# Load the tidyr package if not already loaded
library(tidyr)

# Remove rows with any missing values in the flights dataset
cleaned_flights <- drop_na(flights)

# Display the cleaned dataset
head(cleaned_flights)
```
